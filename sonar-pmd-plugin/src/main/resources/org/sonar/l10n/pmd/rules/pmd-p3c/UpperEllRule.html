 'L' instead of 'l' should be used for long or Long variable because 'l' is easily to be regarded as number 1 in mistake.
<p>Negative example:</p>
<pre>
    //It is hard to tell whether it is number 11 or Long 1.
    Long warn = 1l;
</pre>
 <p>Positive example:</p>
 <pre>
    Long notwarn = 1L;
</pre>
