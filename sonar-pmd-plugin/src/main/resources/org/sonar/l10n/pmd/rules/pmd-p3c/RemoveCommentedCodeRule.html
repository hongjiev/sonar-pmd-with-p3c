<p>Codes or configuration that is noticed to be obsoleted should be resolutely removed from projects.</p>
<p>If you don't want to remove it right now, please use '///' to comment it in the first line.</p>
<p>如果因为种种原因不想立即把代码块删除，请在第一行使用 3 条斜杆 /// 来说明情况。</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
 public static void hello() {
    /// Business is stopped temporarily by the owner.
    // Business business = new Business();
    // business.active();
    System.out.println("it's finished");
 }
</pre>
